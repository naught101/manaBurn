Deep IQ—2015

Deep IQ starts first. Deep IQ turns go as follows:

    Untap
    Upkeep—Make the die roll and complete the requirements of the die roll. Deep IQ starts on Table I. Note advancements in the table.
    If a token creature is put onto the battlefield, roll to determine the abilities of the creature, adding or subtracting the modifier from the roll.
    Determine if any creatures will be attacking that turn; attack only when it makes sense for Deep IQ to attack.
    End the turn.
